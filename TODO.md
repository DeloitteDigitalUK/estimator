# Estimator Todo

## Bugs

- When creating a new project and adding a solution for the first time, the
  list of solutions is not draggable.

## Tests

- POAP `GridPlanner`

## Ideas

- Allow relative start dates ("two periods before the start/end of solution X")
- Allow fixed date items to be added, removed, moved, or resized directly on the grid view?
- Support for "blink estimation" and other forms of triangulation?
