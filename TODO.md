# Bugs

* When creating a new project and adding a solution for the first time, the
  list of solutions is not draggable.

# Tasks

* Make percentiles in solution and project (plan) view user selectable
* Make run count in project (plan) view user selectable

* Hints about estimation quality when building up solution parameters
* Allow each solution to set out which confidence interval to use for the plan?

* Resource forecast (at a particular confidence interval (table)
* Export resource forecast at a particular confidence interval
