# Bugs

* When creating a new project and adding a solution for the first time, the
  list of solutions is not draggable.

# Tasks

* Add burn-up simulation chart?
    - use simulation metadata: `totalBacklog` and items remaining each day after `periods`
    - simulate up to 50 runs?

# Ideas

* Allow each solution to set out which confidence interval to use for the plan?
* Support for "blink estimation" and other forms of triangulation?
