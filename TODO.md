# Bugs

* When creating a new project and adding a solution for the first time, the
  list of solutions is not draggable.

* Calculation of percentile in histogram tooltip is wrong
* Calculation of percentile in project simulator is probably wrong

  - use quantile function instead
  

# Tasks

* Hints about estimation quality when building up solution parameters

* Plan forecast (one swimlane per solution, different bars for different confidence intervals)
* Resource forecast (at a particular confidence interval (table)

* Export plan at a particular confidence interval
* Export resource forecast at a particular confidence interval
